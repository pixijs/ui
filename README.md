## Compatibility

Depending on your version of PixiJS, you'll need to figure out which major version of PixiUI to use.

| PixiJS      | PixiUI         |
|-------------|----------------|
| v7.x        | v1.x           |
| v8.x        | v2.x           |


## Install

```sh
npm install @pixi/ui
```

There is no default export. The correct way to import pixi-ui is:

## Usage
```js
import { Button } from '@pixi/ui';

const button = new Button();

button.onPress.connect(() => console.log('Button pressed!') );
```

To use any of the components you can go to it's page in the [sandbox](https://pixijs.io/ui/storybook/),
and copy/paste the example code to your project (check the `Code` tab):
